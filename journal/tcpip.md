# The TCP/IP Model


The model has four layers

## Application
An application is a program that uses the internet to exchange data, often accessed through a web brower.


## Transport
This layer provides end-to-end communication services for applications, ensuring data is delivered reliably between hosts.

## Internet
responsible for internetworking, connecting different networks together, and moving data packets across them using the Internet protocol (IP)

## Link (Network Access)
This layer handles the transmission of data between devices that are on the same local network.

Protocols in this layer include:
- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- LTE
- Ethernet

## TCP
a fundamental communication protocol that ensures reliable data delivery over the internet by breaking data into packets, sequencing them, and reassembling them at the destination.
