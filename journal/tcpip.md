# The TCP/IP Model


The model has four layers

## Application
An application is a program that uses the internet to exchange data, often accessed through a web brower.

This includes:
- HTTPS/WWW.
- Email
- VOID
- SMS
- IRC

## Transport
This layer provides end-to-end communication services for applications, ensuring data is delivered reliably between hosts.

This includes:
- TCP
- IP

## Internet
responsible for internetworking, connecting different networks together, and moving data packets across them using the Internet protocol (IP)

This includes: 
- IP Address

## Link (Network Access)
This layer handles the transmission of data between devices that are on the same local network.

Protocols in this layer include:
- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- LTE
- Ethernet
