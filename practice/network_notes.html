			<dt> Protocol </dt>
			<dd> standardized set of rules and procedures that allows different devices and systems to communicate and exchange data with each other </dd>

			<dt> Packet </dt>
			<dd> Small, managable unit of data that travels over the internet and other networks </dd>
			<dt> Header </dt>
			<dd> IP/Network packet headeres with routing information like source and destination addresses</dd>

			<dt> Router </dt>
			<dd> a networking device that directs data packets between different computer networks, including the internet </dd>

		<p> The problems that were discussed in class were: </p>
		<ol>
			<li> Dropped Packets </li>
			<li> Order the packets arrived in </li>
			<li> Corruption </li>
		</ol>
		<p> Protocols that we came up with in class that ensured proper communication was to write where the packet came from and who it needed to get to. We also became familiar with our neighbors, which allowed us to somewhat map out the network we were in and navigate easier. </p>
