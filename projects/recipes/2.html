		<p style="text-align: center;"> This food is also very important to my family as it's been served often ever since I was a kid. It's also a key food in family gatherings. They're loaded with flavor and are extremely healthy, so this makes the perfect food to make! </p>

		<h1> How to Assemble: </h1>
		<p style="text-align: center;"> Keep in mind that your ingredients for the spring roll should be cut. Carrots should be cut match-stick style and the rest are pretty self explanatory </p>
		<ol>
			<li> Make sure that noodles are cooked according to packaging </li>
			<li> Once all ingredients are  assembled, make the base by placing a few pieces of lettuce about one-third from the bottom of the circular wrapper (rice wrapper)</li>
			<li> Add the remaning ingredients. The order doesn't matter too much, just pile them on top. Try to leave the top one-third of the wrapper open for wrapping </li>
			<li> Pull the bottom of the wrapper up and over the lower portion of the filling. Try to keep the fillings compact as you roll upwards. </li>
			<li>Evelope the sides and roll it up </li>
		</ol>
		<h1> How to Make the Sauce</h1>
		<ol> 
			<li> Heat pan on medium heat, then add 2 tbsp of neutral cooking oil and 4 cloves of garlic. Saute until lightly browned.</li>
			<li>Add the rest of the ingredients except the chile paste and mix to combine </li>
			<li> Turn up the heat to medium high, and bring to a boil </li>
			<li> Once it hits a boil immediately shut off the heat and add the 1 tsp sambal chile paste. THe sauce will thicken a lot as it cools </li>
			<li> Add the 3 tbsp of crushed peanuts on each serving </li>
		</ol>
