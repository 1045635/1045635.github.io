		<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Bánh mì </h1>
		<p style="text-align: center;"> This recipe is significant to me and my family due to it being a cultural food. It's also, in my opinion, one of the best Vietnamese foods. My family has been making and enjoying this dish for many years so I'd love to be able to share this recipe to others. </p>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Instructions: </h1>
		<ol>
			<li> Gather all ingredients </li>
			<li> Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool. </li>
			<li> Place carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture and let marinte for at least 30 minutes. While vegetables marinate, set an oven rack about 6 inches form the heat source and preheat the broiler. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
			<li> Place chicken on the prepared pan and broil, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Other meats can be used in this recipe. Chicken is just used for this one.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			Place chicken on a cutting board. Cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
		<li>Slice baguette in half lengthwise. Pull out the soft center of the bread, leaving an cavity for the fillings. </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Pulling out the soft center is optional, it's just if you want more room for your fillings.</li>
		</ul>
		<li> lightly toast baguette under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes</li>
		<li> Drain off excess vinegar mixture after vegetables (carrot, radish, and onion) have marinated </li>
		<li> to assemble the sandwich, spread each half of toasted baguette with mayonaise (Pâté is also a very popular addition). Layer chicken on the bottom half of the bread. Top with cucumber, drained pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalapeño. Squeeze lime wedge over fillings and cover with top half of baguette</li>
		<li> Optional: cut into two 6-inch sandwiches to serve </li>
		<li> Enjoy! </li>
